What is spring framework?
- java based framework
- opensource
- light weight
- used to create robust, secure, testable and loosely coupled enterprise level java applications
- making it easier for developers to maintain and scale them allowing to focus on business logic
- without having a need to manage dependencies and complex configuration

What are the features of spring framework?
- has a special design principle known as inversion of control where it automatically creates the object and
  inject dependencies promoting loose coupling between the components, managing bean lifecycle.
- The AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) part of Spring supports unified development by
  ensuring separation of application’s business logic from other system services like logging, security, transactions etc
- it has modular architecture where we can use only the parts needed: core, JDBC, MVC, etc.
- follows layered architecture pattern that helps in the necessary components selection
  along with providing a robust and cohesive framework for J2EE applications development.
- provides highly configurable MVC web application framework
  which has the ability to switch to other frameworks easily with full support for annotations and REST.
- It simplifies managing database transactions without writing boilerplate code.
- provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate or other frameworks)
  into consistent, unchecked exceptions. This introduces abstraction and greatly simplifies exception handling.

What is spring configuration file ?
- it is an XML file that mainly contains the classes information
  and describes how those classes are configured and linked to each other.

What is a bean?
- object / instance of a POJO class
- The beans are created with the configuration metadata
that the users supply to the container (by means of XML or java annotations configurations.)
- They are wired and managed by IOC container

What is IOC ?
- We dont create object manually, spring does that for us
- Instead of your code controlling object creation,
  Spring inverts that control and handles object creation, wiring (dependencies), and lifecycle
  automatically at runtime.

  What is IOC container?
  - The IOC Container is the core of the Spring Framework.
  - it uses Dependency Injection (DI) for managing the application components
  - By:
    	1.	Creating objects (beans)
    	2.  Injects dependencies into them
    	3.	Managing their lifecycle
    	4.	Configures them using metadata (annotations or XML)
  In short, it manages Java objects (beans) from creation to destruction — using Dependency Injection.
  - Now the information(metadata) regarding how and what type of objects need to be created,
    and which services are needed by which components is described in the configuration file
  - Spring’s IOC Container reads bean configuration (via XML, annotations, or Java config),
    instantiates objects, injects their dependencies, and manages their lifecycle
    so that the application code doesn’t need to create or wire objects manually.

What do you understand by DI?
 - Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the dependencies (objects a class needs)
   are provided by an external source (like the Spring IOC Container) instead of the class creating them itself.

 Types of Dependency Injection in Spring
1. Constructor Injection - Dependencies are passed via the class constructor called by IOC
2. Setter Injection - Dependencies are injected via public setter methods called by IOC after instantiating the bean
3. Field Injection - Dependencies are injected directly into fields via annotations like @Autowired
Constructor injection is preferred for mandatory dependencies,
setter injection for optional ones, and field injection is discouraged due to poor testability and tight coupling.

Difference between constructor and setter injection?
- partial injection (allowed in SI)
- overriding the setter property (true for SI)
- creation of new instance upon modification (supported by CI)
- If bean has ---> many properties (CI is preferred) , few properties (SI is preferred)

2 types of IOC container -
  1. Bean factory - Lightweight container, used when memory/resource is limited. Suitable for simple apps.
  2. Application Context - More powerful, commonly used. Adds features like internationalization, event propagation, AOP, etc.

Difference between bean factory and application context -
1. BF - basic container (parent interface)
   AC - advanced container which is built on top of bean factory (child interface with extra features)
2. BF - bean initialization is lazy (loaded on demand)
   AC - it is eager (objects are created in advance)
3. BF - does not manage complete application lifecycle
   AC - manages complete application lifecycle
4. BF - basic resource loading capabilities (xml configuration file etc)
   AC - advance resource loading capabilities
5. BF - limited support to autowiring
   AC - comprehensive support to autowiring
6. BF - limited integration with spring features
   AC - rich integration with spring features
7. BF - internationalization is not supported (it is language specific)
   AC - it is supported
